Answer the following questions and post your answer on your blog:
1. Consider A=matrix(c(2,0,1,3), ncol=2) and B=matrix(c(5,2,4,-1), ncol=2).
a) Find A + B
b) Find A - B

2. Using the diag() function to build a matrix of size 4 with the following values in the diagonal 4,1,2,3.

3. Generate the following matrix:

## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,] 3 1 1 1 1
## [2,] 2 3 0 0 0
## [3,] 2 0 3 0 0
## [4,] 2 0 0 3 0
## [5,] 2 0 0 0 3
